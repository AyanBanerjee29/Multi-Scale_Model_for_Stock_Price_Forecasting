This repository demonstrates the Wavelet Transform using Python. The Wavelet Transform is a powerful mathematical tool for analyzing signals, images, and time series data across multiple scales. Unlike the Fourier Transform, which only provides frequency information, the Wavelet Transform provides both time (localization) and frequency (scale) information.

The Jupyter Notebook Wavelet_Transform.ipynb provides an end-to-end implementation and visualization of wavelet transforms, showcasing their power in signal processing and data analysis.
